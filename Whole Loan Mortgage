A whole loan is a type of MBS, but if you deal in bonds for a living 
and you say “MBS” you’re talking about FN, FH, or GN product. 
Whole loans are private label MBS sold by any number of underwriters 
from Countrywide to Wells Fargo or any of the others.

There is a big difference between private label whole loans and agency paper. 
The agency paper is backed by Fannie, Freddie, or Ginnie…whole loans are not.

Whole loans are loans that are non-conforming, meaning they don’t meet one or more standards 
to be included in an agency wrapper. It could be any of a number of things 
from the size of the loan to the documentation required to get the loan, etc.

At any rate, whole loans carry more risk, therefore trade at wider spreads than agency MBS.

So while it’s true that whole loans are a type of MBS, they are always distinguished 
when being shown to a customer as a “whole loan” or a “whole loan MBS”.

Generally a whole loan will have a ticker like “CSMS 2007-1 2A1” and an agency will be “FN 888797”.

I’ve generalized a lot here to keep things simple. Hope it helps.
